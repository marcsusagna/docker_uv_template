# uv_template

Speed up setup

Lightweight template to manage a python app with UV irrespective of CICD platform. 

It is based on [simple-modern-uv](https://github.com/jlevy/simple-modern-uv)

Added precommit hooks and isolation in reproducible environment for dev and deployment. Rename to dockerized uv tempalte?

Compared to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-docker-example/blob/main/Dockerfile also docker image for development
